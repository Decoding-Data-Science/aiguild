        "\n",
        "2) EQUIPMENT OVERVIEW\n",
        "- Asset Tag: P-201A (Cooling Water Pump – Duty)\n",
        "- Type: Horizontal centrifugal pump, electric motor driven\n",
        "- Normal Operating Range:\n",
        "  - Discharge Pressure: 6.0–7.5 bar\n",
        "  - Flow: 1,500–2,200 m3/h (depending on condenser demand)\n",
        "  - Bearing Temperature (DE/NDE): 55–80°C typical (alarm at 90°C, trip at 100°C)\n",
        "  - Motor Current: 120–165 A typical\n",
        "- Instruments:\n",
        "  - TT-201A-DE / TT-201A-NDE (bearing temp)\n",
        "  - PT-201A-DIS (discharge pressure)\n",
        "  - FT-201A (flow)\n",
        "  - VT-201A (vibration monitoring, if installed)\n",
        "\n",
        "3) INCIDENT TRIGGER (SYMPTOMS)\n",
        "Typical event conditions reported in DCS:\n",
        "- Alarm: “P-201A Bearing Temp High” (TT-201A-DE > 90°C)\n",
        "- Operator notes:\n",
        "  - Discharge pressure dropping or unstable\n",
        "  - Abnormal vibration trend or noise near coupling\n",
        "  - Seal flush line temperature elevated (if applicable)\n",
        "  - Motor current rising above normal range\n",
        "\n",
        "4) SAFETY FIRST (MANDATORY)\n",
        "Before any field action:\n",
        "- Follow plant LOTO procedure if opening guards, removing coupling cover, or working on energized equipment.\n",
        "- Wear PPE: gloves, face shield, safety shoes, hearing protection.\n",
        "- Hot surfaces hazard: bearing housings and casing can exceed safe touch temperature.\n",
        "- If leak observed near mechanical seal, treat as pressurized water hazard.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) QUICK STABILIZATION (FIRST 5 MINUTES)\n",
        "Goal: prevent equipment damage and maintain plant cooling demand.\n",
        "A. Confirm the alarm source:\n",
        "   - Verify TT values for DE and NDE.\n",
        "   - Cross-check with handheld IR thermometer if safe.\n",
        "B. Reduce stress on the pump (operator action):\n",
        "   - Verify pump is operating near its best efficiency point (BEP).\n",
        "   - If suction pressure is low, check upstream strainers and basin level.\n",
        "C. If temperature continues rising rapidly:\n",
        "   - Prepare to start standby pump P-201B (if available).\n",
        "   - Coordinate with Control Room Supervisor for controlled switchover.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) ROOT CAUSE CHECKLIST (MOST COMMON)\n",
        "A. Low suction / cavitation\n",
        "- Evidence:\n",
        "  - “Gravel” sound, fluctuating discharge pressure, vibration spikes\n",
        "- Checks:\n",
        "  - Cooling water basin level low\n",
        "  - Suction strainer DP high (clogging)\n",
        "  - Air ingress at suction flange / gasket\n",
        "- Immediate action:\n",
        "  - Clean strainer (per permit), restore basin level, verify suction valves fully open\n",
        "\n",
        "B. Bearing lubrication issue\n",
        "- Evidence:\n",
        "  - DE bearing heats faster than NDE\n",
        "  - Grease purge blocked or grease contaminated\n",
        "- Checks:\n",
        "  - Grease type correct per OEM?\n",
        "  - Over-greasing can cause heat (too much grease churn)\n",
        "- Action:\n",
        "  - Follow OEM lubrication interval and quantity\n",
        "  - If contamination suspected, plan bearing inspection\n",
        "\n",
        "C. Misalignment / coupling issue\n",
        "- Evidence:\n",
        "  - Vibration increasing across 1X running speed\n",
        "  - Coupling hot spot, noise, abnormal wear\n",
        "- Action:\n",
        "  - Schedule laser alignment check after switching to standby pump\n",
        "\n",
        "D. Mechanical seal / seal flush failure\n",
        "- Evidence:\n",
        "  - Seal area hot, leakage rate changes, flush line blocked\n",
        "- Checks:\n",
        "  - Seal flush valve open? Flush flow present?\n",
        "  - Flush strainer clogged?\n",
        "- Action:\n",
        "  - Restore flush flow, inspect flush strainer, log in CMMS\n",
        "\n",
        "E. Blocked discharge / operation at low flow\n",
        "- Evidence:\n",
        "  - Discharge pressure high but flow low\n",
        "  - Pump recirculation/min-flow line closed\n",
        "- Action:\n",
        "  - Verify min-flow / recirculation line per procedure\n",
        "  - Avoid prolonged low-flow operation (overheating risk)\n",
        "\n",
        "7) CONTROL ROOM DECISION: WHEN TO SWITCH TO STANDBY PUMP\n",
        "Switch from P-201A to P-201B if any of the following:\n",
        "- Bearing temperature > 95°C and rising for 3 minutes\n",
        "- Vibration exceeds site limit (e.g., > 7.1 mm/s RMS)\n",
        "- Motor current > 180 A with unstable discharge pressure\n",
        "- Visible seal leak worsening or safety risk present\n",
        "\n",
        "8) DOCUMENTATION & SYSTEMS (SAP / CMMS / DCS)\n",
        "Log the event with:\n",
        "- DCS Alarm Screenshot / Trend (TT, PT, FT, current)\n",
        "- Operator logbook entry (time, alarm, actions taken)\n",
        "- SAP PM Notification template:\n",
        "  - Equipment: P-201A\n",
        "  - Symptom: Overheating DE bearing temp high\n",
        "  - Suspected cause: (choose from checklist)\n",
        "  - Immediate action: (e.g., switched to P-201B, cleaned strainer)\n",
        "  - Recommended follow-up: alignment check, bearing inspection, seal flush check\n",
        "\n",
        "9) RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP WORK (NEXT 24–72 HOURS)\n",
        "- Inspect suction strainer DP transmitter calibration\n",
        "- Review vibration spectrum (if condition monitoring exists)\n",
        "- Check lubrication records (grease type/quantity/interval)\n",
        "- Verify pump curve vs operating point (ensure near BEP)\n",
        "- Conduct coupling alignment and soft foot check\n",
        "- If repeated events: perform RCA (5-Why) and update PM plan\n",
